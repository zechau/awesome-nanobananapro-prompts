**24. Acid Design/Y2K Style Poster Conversion**

> **Prompt**: Please analyze this photo I uploaded and convert it into a modern graphic design poster.

Background transformation: Replace the original background with an abstract, frosted glass texture background. This new background should retain the original background's color tendencies (like green and brown) but completely blur specific details. Core composition: Behind the subject, add a striking solid color rectangle block. Extract the color from the brightest color in the photo. Add main title text related to the photo subject, using a bold, designer sans-serif font. Most importantly, place this title layer behind the subject to create spatial perception of the subject obscuring the text. Detail addition: Add some small, informational text related to the image content at different positions to create visual hierarchy. At the bottom of the flower stem, add some transparent tape material to make the flower look like it's pasted on the poster, increasing realism and collage feel. Style unification: Finally, ensure the entire poster follows Y2K aesthetics or acid design, with rich textures and layers. Let the title and color blocks have some transparency fusion with the background's glass texture for overall coordination

### **IV. Advanced Features and Applications**

#### **Converting Articles to Styled Infographics**

Due to enhanced long text rendering capabilities, current popular tests focus on generating various infographics - from dense knowledge explanations to classic ancient poetry filling blackboards and walls, or math problem solutions.

For example, converting input text verbatim into glossy magazine content:

![Image](https://maynor123-1301929665.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/202511211815293.jpeg)

Image credit: X@fofrAI | Prompt: Put this whole text, verbatim, into a photo of a glossy magazine article on a desk, with photos, beautiful typography design, pull quotes and brave formatting. The text: [...the unformatted article]

Some users directly provide Markdown documents or PDFs, asking Nano Banana Pro to convert them into infographics, resulting in design-friendly, information-accurate images.

![Image](https://maynor123-1301929665.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/202511211815051.jpeg)

Image credit: X@tobi | Prompt: Make this markdown transcript into a infographic

Because Nano Banana Pro can now use Google search, and reasoning and understanding capabilities have greatly improved, when generating infographics, if requirements aren't too strict, simply telling it what kind of infographic to create can achieve results without worrying too much about prompt structure.

![Image](https://maynor123-1301929665.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/202511211815782.jpeg)

Prompt: Generate a 2026 China holiday schedule infographic, all in Chinese, 4K quality, 16:9

For example, when asking it to generate next year's holiday information, I saw Gemini's reply included clear use of Google search results, with multiple official announcement webpage links.

Many beautiful infographic tests have relatively simple prompts, basically "help me generate an xx infographic".

#### **Generating Exciting Comic Strips**

Combining long text rendering and strong consistency maintenance, besides rendering text-heavy infographics, Nano Banana Pro is perfect for creating comic strips. It now supports generating multiple photos in a single request.

Some users just uploaded one image, then input "create and draw a multi-panel comic based on this image" prompt, and got multiple self-written plot comics, and they continue updating subsequent plots.

If you also have public social media platforms, try letting Nano Banana Pro generate comics from your past week's life.

We tried having Nano Banana Pro generate life comics for Musk and Altman. In the Gemini web version, it gave us three images at once, and you can see from the comic content that it really does have world knowledge.

As for the previous generation Nano Banana's consistency capabilities, the Pro version still performs excellently. Like dressing a model in different clothes, maintaining model and clothing consistency; also like putting some logos on different peripherals, or making small element replacements to existing product images, Nano Banana Pro performs very well.

In Google AI Studio's official case studies, multiple infographic generation and comic production examples are also given. They built multiple projects using the Nano Banana Pro model.

However, the Nano Banana Pro model API is not free to call, so these six AI Studio projects all require binding payment methods to use.

But these projects all provide source code, and we can modify them based on their foundation. By checking the underlying code, we can also see the underlying prompts.

![Image](https://maynor123-1301929665.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/202511211815915.png)

We extracted one project's prompt, which is to generate four styles of infographics from input links.

First, we can use the following prompt to summarize web link content, replacing **${url}** with the actual article link to analyze. **${language}** can be directly replaced with Chinese to present in Chinese.

You are an expert Information Designer. Your goal is to extract the essential structure from a web page to create a clear, educational infographic.

Analyze the content at this URL: **${url}**

TARGET LANGUAGE: **${language}**.

Provide a structured breakdown specifically designed for visual representation in **${language}**:

1. INFOGRAPHIC HEADLINE: The core topic in 5 words or less (in **${language}**).
2. KEY TAKEAWAYS: The 3 to 5 most important distinct points, steps, or facts (in **${language}**). THESE WILL BE THE MAIN SECTIONS OF THE IMAGE.
3. SUPPORTING DATA: Any specific numbers, percentages, or very short quotes that add credibility.
4. VISUAL METAPHOR IDEA: Suggest ONE simple visual concept that best fits this content (e.g., "a roadmap with milestones", "a funnel", "three contrasting pillars", "a circular flowchart").

Keep the output concise and focused purely on what should be ON the infographic. Ensure all content is in **${language}.**

After getting this article summary, we can start image generation.

Create a professional, high-quality educational infographic based strictly on this structured content plan:

**${structuralSummary}**

VISUAL DESIGN RULES:

\- **${styleGuidelines}**

\- LANGUAGE: The text within the infographic MUST be written in **${language}**.

\- LAYOUT: MUST follow the "VISUAL METAPHOR IDEA" from the plan above if one was provided.

\- TYPOGRAPHY: Clean, highly readable sans-serif fonts. The "INFOGRAPHIC HEADLINE" must be prominent at the top.

\- CONTENT: Use the actual text from "KEY TAKEAWAYS" in the image. Do not use placeholder text like Lorem Ipsum.

\- GOAL: The image must be informative and readable as a standalone graphic.

The image generation prompt is relatively simple. We replace the previous article link analysis result into the **${structuralSummary}** part; then for **${styleGuidelines}**, we can choose any of the four styles mentioned in the official project.

Interesting and fun style Fun & Playful: styleGuidelines = STYLE: Fun, playful, vibrant 2D vector illustrations. Use bright colors, rounded shapes, and a friendly tone.

Simple minimalist style Clean Minimalist: styleGuidelines = STYLE: Ultra-minimalist. Lots of whitespace, thin lines, limited color palette (1-2 accent colors max). Very sophisticated and airy.

Dark mode tech style Dark Mode Tech: styleGuidelines = STYLE: Dark mode technical aesthetic. Dark slate/black background with bright, glowing accent colors (cyan, lime green) for data points.

Modern editorial style Modern Editorial: styleGuidelines = STYLE: Modern, flat vector illustration style. Clean, professional, and editorial (like a high-end tech magazine). Cohesive, mature color palette.

Following this method, we gave Gemini the article about Nano Banana Pro's release and got the following infographics.

#### **Official Intervention: 7 Image Generation Tips**

Besides using these already-written prompts, Google has painstakingly provided detailed Nano Banana Pro usage techniques, partly because they're afraid we won't operate properly, leading to misunderstandings about the model. On the other hand, Google really hopes Nano Banana Pro won't just be a fun image generation model - they truly expect it to improve our productivity.

The importance of prompts for getting precise content control, besides the model's own capabilities, the remaining determining factor is the prompts themselves. Google mentions again that **a good prompt should clearly include subject, composition, action, location, style, and editing instructions.**

Briefly describe the image subject with concise language, for example, specifically explaining what people or things are in the picture? For composition, tell the model how the photo is framed? Is it close-up, wide-angle lens, low-angle shot, or portrait lens, etc.

![Image](https://maynor123-1301929665.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/202511211815961.jpeg)

Example: A fluffy calico cat wearing a small wizard hat, casting magic on a sunlit grassland at sunset, low-angle shot, photorealism

Next is describing the action, what's happening to the subject in the picture? And where it's happening, describing the specific scene. Finally, determine the photo style we want, for example, 3D animation, film noir, watercolor, photorealism, 1990s product photography, etc., different overall aesthetic style choices.

**If pursuing more controllable image generation effects, Google also mentioned further improving camera, lighting, and format details to refine prompt content.**

For example, current Nano Banana Pro supports custom composition and aspect ratios. We can choose 9:16 vertical posters, 21:9 cinematic wide screens, and other screen formats.

Additionally, in photography and lighting details, Google's reference prompt is to guide shooting like a cinematographer, with terminology as professional as possible, for example, "low-angle shot, shallow depth of field (f/1.8), golden hour backlight creating long shadows, cinematic color grading with soft blue-green tones"; and other prompt language.

![Image](https://maynor123-1301929665.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/202511211815429.jpeg)

Example: A fluffy calico cat wearing a small wizard hat, casting magic on a sunlit grassland at sunset, low-angle shot, shallow depth of field (f/1.8), golden hour backlight creating long shadows, cinematic color grading with soft blue-green tones. Photorealism. 21:9 cinematic widescreen. Title "Cat Magic Casting" displayed at top in cute rainbow font.

When handling text processing tasks, need to clearly specify text content and display position, and corresponding fonts. For chart infographics, emphasize accuracy requirements in prompts and ensure input is correct.

When involving multi-image reference and image editing, need to clearly tell the model each image's role and specific editing needs.

Mastering prompt formulas is just the foundation. Next are some officially recommended specific application scenarios for Nano Banana Pro.

#### **7 Key Application Scenarios**

**1. AI Text Generation**: Previously, AI image generation feared text, producing garbled characters. The new model has made huge improvements in text rendering. We can directly ask it to generate poster titles, complex charts, or detailed model specifications.

Prompt: 制作一张信息图，用中文展示如何制作老北京豆汁儿 (Make an infographic in Chinese showing how to make traditional Beijing fermented soybean milk)

**2. Physics and History Knowledge**: Based on Gemini 3's reasoning capabilities, this model has richer world knowledge. It can generate logically sound charts or historically accurate scenes.

**3. Up to 14 Images Supported! Super Fusion Method**: This is probably one of the most powerful features of the new model. It allows us to input 6 to 14 (specific quantity depends on platform) completely unrelated images for AI to fuse and create entirely new scenes.

Using the multi-image input feature, we can have the same character maintain facial and feature consistency across different scenes, and even maintain similarity in group shots. This is perfect for creating comics or storyboards.

Prompt: 将这些图像组合成一张 16:9 格式的适当排列的电影图像，并将模特身上的裙子换成图像中的裙子 (Combine these images into a properly arranged 16:9 format movie image, and replace the model's skirt with the skirt in the image)

**4. Precise Size Adjustment**: Try different aspect ratios and generate clear visual effects with 1K, 2K, or 4K resolutions on various products.

**5. "Point-and-Shoot" Precise Image Editing**: Google calls this studio-level control editing for achieving more professional effects.

**6. Brand Design Magic Tool: Automatic Logo Application**: For designers, compared to first-gen nano banana, its consistency maintenance ability is stronger. Brand companies can have AI print corresponding logos, patterns or artwork on 3D objects, while the printed logos automatically adjust to the original image's natural lighting and texture.

**7. Cross-language Seamless Translation**: It's not just an image generation tool, it can directly "translate" text within images.

Prompt: 将三个黄蓝罐头上的所有英文文字翻译成韩语，其他内容保持不变 (Translate all English text on three yellow-blue cans to Korean, keep everything else unchanged)

Although Nano Banana Pro is very powerful, in the official documentation, they also honestly list some current limitations. Everyone should pay attention when using them. Mainly some very small text rendering, complex spellings may still have errors.

Additionally, if you use it to generate data charts or infographics, they also remind that manual data verification is necessary. Although AI has logic, it can sometimes confidently talk nonsense - after all, we've all seen how serious AI hallucinations can be.

Finally, when performing extremely complex lighting changes or image fusion, generated images may occasionally have unnatural artifacts.

**Currently this model is available on Gemini App and Gemini web version**, while on AI Studio and Vertex platforms it requires paid API to experience.

### **IV. Official Prompt Engineering Guidelines**

Google emphasizes the importance of **good prompts** that clearly include **subject, composition, action, location, style, and editing instructions**.

**Basic prompt structure**: Briefly describe the image subject, composition (close-up, wide-angle, low-angle shot, portrait shot, etc.), action, scene location, and desired style (3D animation, film noir, watercolor, photorealism, 1990s product photography, etc.).

**Advanced controls**: For more precise generation, enhance camera, lighting, and format details:

- Custom aspect ratios (9:16 portrait posters, 21:9 cinematic widescreen)
- Professional photography terminology: "Low-angle shot, shallow depth of field (f/1.8), golden hour backlight creating long shadows, cinematic color grading with soft blue-green tones"
- Text processing: Specify text content, display position, and fonts
- Charts and infographics: Emphasize accuracy requirements
- Multi-image references: Clearly specify each image's role and editing requirements

#### **7 Key Application Scenarios**

1. **AI Text Generation**: AI can now "write" text instead of creating garbled characters. Generate poster titles, complex charts, or detailed model specifications
2. **Physics and History Knowledge**: Based on Gemini 3's reasoning capabilities, generates logically sound charts or historically accurate scenes
3. **14-Image Fusion**: Supports inputting 6-14 completely unrelated images for AI to blend into new creations. Excellent for comics and storyboards
4. **Precise Sizing**: Generate 1K, 2K, or 4K resolution visuals with different aspect ratios
5. **Studio-level Editing**: Professional control editing with "point-and-shoot" precision
6. **Brand Design: Automatic Logo Application**: Stronger consistency maintenance than first-gen nano banana. Automatically adjusts logos to natural lighting and texture on 3D objects
7. **Cross-language Translation**: Directly "translate" text within images
