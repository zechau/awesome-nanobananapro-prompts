### **Foreword: Google Releases Nano Banana Pro, Ushering in a New Era of AI Image Generation**

OpenAI faces its darkest hour.

Google's AI offensive shows no signs of weakening. While Gemini 3 Pro recently targeted the "frontend" domain, today it's the design industry's turn.

The newly released **Nano Banana Pro (Gemini 3 Pro Image)** delivers another powerful punch in image generation capabilities. The jobs of junior designers may be in jeopardy.

### **III. Advanced Features and Applications**

#### **Information Graphics Generation**

With enhanced long text rendering capabilities, popular online tests focus on generating various infographics - from dense knowledge explanations to classic ancient poetry filling blackboards and walls, or math problem solutions.

For example, converting input text verbatim into glossy magazine content:

Image credit: X@fofrAI | Prompt: Put this whole text, verbatim, into a photo of a glossy magazine article on a desk, with photos, beautiful typography design, pull quotes and brave formatting.

Some users directly provide Markdown documents or PDFs, asking Nano Banana Pro to convert them into infographics, resulting in design-friendly, information-accurate images.

Image credit: X@tobi | Prompt: Make this markdown transcript into a infographic

#### **Comic Strip Generation**

Combining long text rendering and strong consistency maintenance, Nano Banana Pro is perfect for creating comic strips. It now supports generating multiple photos in a single request.

Users simply upload an image and input prompts like "Create and draw a multi-panel comic based on this image" to get multi-panel comics with self-written plots.

### **IV. Official Prompt Engineering Guidelines**

Google emphasizes the importance of **good prompts** that clearly include **subject, composition, action, location, style, and editing instructions**.

**Basic prompt structure**: Briefly describe the image subject, composition (close-up, wide-angle, low-angle shot, portrait shot, etc.), action, scene location, and desired style (3D animation, film noir, watercolor, photorealism, 1990s product photography, etc.).

**Advanced controls**: For more precise generation, enhance camera, lighting, and format details:

- Custom aspect ratios (9:16 portrait posters, 21:9 cinematic widescreen)
- Professional photography terminology: "Low-angle shot, shallow depth of field (f/1.8), golden hour backlight creating long shadows, cinematic color grading with soft blue-green tones"
- Text processing: Specify text content, display position, and fonts
- Charts and infographics: Emphasize accuracy requirements
- Multi-image references: Clearly specify each image's role and editing requirements

#### **7 Key Application Scenarios**

1. **AI Text Generation**: AI can now "write" text instead of creating garbled characters. Generate poster titles, complex charts, or detailed model specifications
2. **Physics and History Knowledge**: Based on Gemini 3's reasoning capabilities, generates logically sound charts or historically accurate scenes
3. **14-Image Fusion**: Supports inputting 6-14 completely unrelated images for AI to blend into new creations. Excellent for comics and storyboards
4. **Precise Sizing**: Generate 1K, 2K, or 4K resolution visuals with different aspect ratios
5. **Studio-level Editing**: Professional control editing with "point-and-shoot" precision
6. **Brand Design: Automatic Logo Application**: Stronger consistency maintenance than first-gen nano banana. Automatically adjusts logos to natural lighting and texture on 3D objects
7. **Cross-language Translation**: Directly "translate" text within images

Prompt: Translate all English text on three yellow-blue cans to Korean, keep everything else unchanged
